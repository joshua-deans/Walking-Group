# Walking-Group

### This was a project for CMPT 276 (Intro to Software Engineering) taken in Summer 2018 with Brian Fraser. I worked with 3 other team members to create this application.

##### Unfortunately, this project relies on API Keys, and a server that are not provided. Therefore it is not usable in it's current state.

Walking Group is an Android application that encourages students to walk to class. It gives them features to walk safely with a walking group, and communicate with group leaders and their parents. Parents of the student can also monitor their children, keeping them safe.

This project interacts with a server made by SFU for this project. The project is written in native Java, and interacts with the server using a Retrofit REST interface.

Features of this application include:
* User authentication
* Interaction with Google Maps (using Google Maps API)
* Ability to monitor and be monitored by a user
* Ability to join or create a walking group (using Google Place Picker API)
* Messaging (either emergency or non-emergency messages between groups or parents)
* Automatic GPS uploading (as a background service)
* Purchasable titles
* Purchasable themes
